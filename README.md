## Getting Started

- Clone the project to your local system by running `git clone git@github.com:Wilson-Chu/tinyapp.git` (for SSH users).

## Future Improvements

- The Logout button and user email display do not line up horizontally with the left-most elements. Will need to fix the CSS at some time.
- Also, when logged in, the header margins at top and bottom increase unexpectedly. Will need to fix CSS.
- Predefined urlDatabase information does not load upon registration.
- Error messages are extremely basic. Can update with better UX/UI considerations.
